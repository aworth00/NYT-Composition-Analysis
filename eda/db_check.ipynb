      "SAO PAULO —  Nine inmates were killed, 14 were injured, and dozens escaped in a prison riot on Monday, national news media reported, in the latest example of Brazil's continuing difficulties maintaining control over its notoriously violent penal system.\n",
      "According to newspaper O Estado de São Paulo, 106 prisoners escaped the prison in the city of Goiânia, near the capital of Brasilia. Authorities recaptured 27 of the escapees, but the rest remained at large.\n",
      "One of the nine killed in the mayhem was decapitated, news media reported, sparking memories of a prison riot that occurred one year ago today in the Amazon in which 56 people died, several of whom were decapitated and thrown over prison walls.\n",
      "That riot, which was rooted in a long-standing gang rivalry, came at the beginning of a January marred by widespread prison violence, with 130 prisoners dying in the first 20 days of 2017.\n",
      "Brazil's prisons, which suffer endemic violence, are often severely overcrowded. Rights group call prison conditions medieval, with food scarce and cells often so packed inmates have no space to lie down.\n",
      "In comments on Monday to newspaper Folha de São Paulo, the head of Brazil's prison guard union, Jorimar Bastos, criticized the amount of resources allocated for oversight at the Goiânia prison, saying only five guards were assigned to watch over 900 prisoners.\n",

       "'SYDNEY, Australia, Feb. 1 - Investors in Macquarie Bank, the Australian investment firm, have become accustomed to making money. The shares have consistently outperformed other Australian blue chips, fueled each year by record profit and the return to shareholders has soared over the past decade.\\nBut Macquarie\\'s run was interrupted yesterday when its share price took its biggest fall in almost four years. The stock dropped 7.4 percent, to 63.45 Australian dollars, ($47.75), after Allan E. Moss, the chief executive, warned that profit from the investment banking division, the company\\'s star performer, would fall significantly when full-year earnings were reported in March.\\nThe key to Macquarie\\'s success has been its ability to build a global niche market by acquiring public works like toll roads and airports and offering them to investors.\\nIt has been so successful with these multibillion-dollar deals that major Wall Street firms have been rushing to follow suit. After the share price decline and warnings about investment banking income on Wednesday, some are questioning whether the company has lost some of its shine.\\nTo fans of Macquarie stock, the sell-off was an overreaction. Mr. Moss, an unassuming and conservative manager, told investors and analysts that the bank was still on track to record an annual profit that was slightly up from the record 823 million Australian dollars ($619 million) reported last year. Many analysts have been forecasting full-year earnings of 950 million dollars ($715 million) and setting a share-price target above 80 dollars ($60) for 2006.\\nIn recent years, Macquarie has been a master at surprising the markets with results that exceeded expectations. \"The thing is, the market keeps expecting it to set new highs,\" said Don Hamson, fund manager at State Street Global Advisors, an investment management company based in Boston. \"We have had two or three years of exceeding expectations, so you have to keep exceeding it more each year.\"\\nIn the last few weeks, the bank\\'s notoriety outside Australia for audacious deal-making has been growing, with its hostile takeover bid for the London Stock Exchange and multibillion-dollar purchases of toll roads in the United States and Europe.\\n\"You would expect the deal flow to increase over time because our capital base is increasing and our staff numbers are increasing,\" Richard Sheppard, Macquarie\\'s deputy managing director, said in an interview before the sell-off on Wednesday. \"I think the key to our success is that we have been successful in finding and acquiring attractive assets for investors and then we have had the capacity, aided by good market conditions, to go out and raise the capital for those investments.\"\\nAnalysts say Macquarie, based in Sydney, has emerged as the undoubted leader in the business of financial re-engineering of infrastructure. The bank and its subsidiary funds have about 112 billion in Australian dollars ($84.2 billion) in assets under management.'"

       "array([ \"MODERATOR. Good day. President Carter and I are in the so‐called Oval Office of the While House. We're in a couple of wing‐back chairs in front of a coffee table. And in front of the fireplace across from us is the desk at which the President spends much of his day working; over to the left the large doors opening out onto the beautiful Rose Garden of the White House on a very nice spring‐like day here in Washington.\\nFollowing is a transcript of President Carter's call‐in radio program yesterday, which was moderated by Walter Cronkite and recorded by The New York Times through the facilities of CBS News and the CBS radio network:\\nThis is a unique occasion, and in the sense that it marks a new approach to communication between the President and the people of the United States it is indeed historic. Unique, historic, and we must also say an experiment, since a President has never taken part before in this sort of a broadcast.\\nNow here's the way we want it to work, we hope it works. We'll receive phone calls from all over the country. We expect people to ask questions on many, many subjects, of course. There'll be no censorship at all, no prescreening in that sense. However, you should know that it's not going to be easy, of course, to get through to him because there have to be just a limited number of lines coming to us here at the White House.\\nNow my advice is that if you get a busy signal you do like you do when you get a busy signal any time—you just hang up and try again. Now when you do get through we'll verify your call by name and hometown. And then I'll introduce you to the President and you may talk directly with him.\\nA Call for Brevity\\nPlease remember that we want to give just as many of you callers as possible an opportunity to ask President Carter your questions; therefore I'm going to be just a little bit ruthless here in cutting off any long‐winded statements from our callers. We do want to hear from you, the President wants your opinions and so forth, but don't make a speech, will you? In other words, get to your question right away, ask it just as clearly and directly as possible. And just as in Presidential news conferences you will have an opportufiity for a follow‐up question if you think that it's necessary.\\nMr. President, we're very pleased that you've accepted our CBS News invitation and are giving this time to let the nation “Ask President Carter.”\\nMR. CARTER. Thank you, Walter. I'm glad to have a chance to let people have direct access to me. And in the process of answering 50 to 100 questions this afternoon—in an unrehearsed way, not knowing what's going to come next—I think the people will learn something and I know I'll learn a lot about what is of interest to them.\\nAlso, I believe that if there are tens of thousands of folks who want to get through and can't do it, in listening to the other questions that are asked they're very likely to get an answer to their question. So I'm looking forward to the two hours and whenever you're ready, I am.\\nRelations With Amin\\nCALLER NO. 1\\nMODERATOR. All right, Mr. President, we're ready here and I think that Joseph Willman of Sterling Heights, Mich., is ready out there in Sterling Heights with the first question.\\nQ. First of all, I'd like to say good afternoon to President Carter and Mr. Cronkite. Now my question right now is according to the U.P.I. story in today's Detroit News, Idi Amin has said that now he has killed 7,000 Christians. With this and other happenings there, how can we with good conscience trust a man with such an ego, and if the time arises will use force to get them out, even though a confrontation with this country is expected by Amin?\\nA. Well, it's hard to know how to answer that question about future events. As you know, we had what was on the border of a crisis last weekend. The attitude that we took was constantly to monitor what is going on in Uganda; to deal directly with Amin in a very forceful way to let him know that we were expecting American lives to be protected.\\nWe also got the help of several national leaders who are quite close to Amin, primarily those of the Moslem faith, and they contacted him directly. We also got the Federal Republic of Germany, West Germany, who has diplomatic leaders in Uganda—Entebbe, Uganda—to contact Amin. And he was constantly giving me assurance through cables that the Americans would not be hurt.\\nAs you know, the outcome of that weekend's tension was that he eventually said that the meeting with the Americans was called off and that anyone who wanted to leave or come in to Uganda from out of the country would be permitted to do so.\\nI think that it's obvious that we'll do whatever we can to protect American lives throughout the world. We have in the past, before I became President, informed the American people in Uganda—and I might say in several other countries around the world—that there was a potentially dangerous circumstance for them. And that if they were primarily concerned with a peaceful life they ought to change countries.\\nWe do know that most of the persons who are Americans in Uganda are missionaries, deeply committed to their own religious faith. They've had an option to leave and they've decided to stay.\\nSo I think at this time T feel that the American lives there will be protected. We did act, I think, forcefully and effectively with Amin. We had a lot of help from other nations. And I can't say what T will do in the future except to try to handle the situation similarly to what I did last weekend.\\nCALLER NO. 2\\nMODERATOR: Let's take our next\\ncaller. it's Pete Belloni of Denver, Colo. CARTER. Go ahead Mr. Belloni. Q. Good afternoon, Mr. President. A. Good afternoon.\\nQ. Mr. President, your proposal of\\nincreasing the gasoline tax by 25 cents a gallon, would that put quite a burden on the people of this country who are already financially strapped with higher taxes and fuel bills?\\nA. Well, Mr. Belloni, I've never proposed any such thing and don't know where the story originated.\\nQ. It was in the paper last week, in the Rocky Mountain News.\\nA. I don't believe the story was attributed to me in any way because I've never commented on that at all and have never even insinuated to anyone that I was going to raise the gasoline tax by 25 cents.\\nQ. Have you heard about it though?\\nA, I had one news question about it and responded the same way I am to you—that I don't know anything about the proposal and have no intention of doing it.\\nI might say that on April 20, I will, if plans go the way we have them now, make a speech to the joint session of the Congress, probably in the evening, and explain for the first time in our country what a comprehensive energy policy is. We don't have one at this moment and we've been working on it ever since even before I became President.\\nSo April 20 we will try to spell out an approach to the energy problem that will involve all aspects of it—oil, coal, solar energy, obviously nuclear power, hydroelectric, pricing, mandatory efficiency, conservation—voluntary—and so forth. And this may or may not involve any changes in the price structure, but I certainly have not considered and have no intention of any such increases you've talked about this afternoon.\\nQ. Yes sir, Mr. President. Whoever brought out the story, do they know who did it or anything, or how it leaked out or anything?\\nA. Nell, it didn't leak anywhere from the White House because that's not a decision that's been made in the White House.\\nQ. I see. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. It's been an honor.\\nA. Thank you, Pete, I've enjoyed talking to you.\\nQ. Thank you very much.\\nCALLER NO. 3\\nMODERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Belloni. The next question, Mr. President, is from Mark Fendrick of Brooklyn, N.Y. Mr. Fendrick, go ahead.\\nQ. Good afternoon, Mr. President. What I'd like to ask is in relationship ‘to the attempts for returning to a normal relationship with Cuba. Now, in the paper the last couple of days here in New York, there's been talk about the Yankees baseball team going to Cuba. Do you think that this is a possibility in the near future, and do you think that normal relations to Cuba are possible again in the near future?\\nA. Well, there are varying degrees of relations with Cuba. As you know, we have had some discussions with them in the past, for instance, on the antihijacking agreement, which expires this spring. And we now have no visitation rights by American citizens to go to Vietnam, to North Korea, to Cuba and one or two other nations. We do have a procedure already in effect whereby a limited number of Americans can go into Cuba without using a passport because of prior agreement with the Cuban Government.\\nI would like to do what I can to ease tensions with Cuba—it's only 90 miles, as you know, from the Florida coast—and I don't know yet what we will do. Before any full normalization of relations can take place, though, Cuba would have to make some fairly substantial changes in their attitude.\\nI would like to insist, for instance, that they not interfere in the internal affairs of countries in this hemisphere and that they decrease their military involvement in Africa and that they reinforce a commitment to human rights by releasing political prisoners that have been in jail now in Cuba for 17 or 18 years, things of that kind.\\nBut I think before we can reach that point we'll have to have discussions with them, and I do intend to see discussions initiated with Cuba quite early on re‐establishing the antihijacking agreement, arriving at a fishing agreement between us and Cuba since our 200‐mile limits do overlap between Florida and Cuba. And I would not be averse in the future to seeing visitation rights permitted as well.\\nQ. In relationship, though, to the Yankees playing an exhibition game there, I've noticed that Secretary Vance has hacked this idea. Do you think that that's a possibility this season?\\nA. It's a possibility, yes.\\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President.\\nMODERATOR. Mr. President, may I ask—it seemed that Secretary Vance indicated just the last day or so that there would be no preconditions in discussions with Cuba, Are you now saying that there will be?\\nA. No. The preconditions that I describe would be prior to full normalization of relationships, the establishment of embassies in both our countries as they complete freedom of trade between the two countries. But you couldn't possibly arrive at a solution to some of those questions without discussions. So we will begin discussions with Cuba if they approve the idea fairly shortly, on the items that I've described — increased visitations of Americans to and from Cuba, the fishing rights question that has to be resolved for the protection of our own fishermen, and also the antihijacking agreement, which has been in effect in the past but is about to expire.\\nProviding Jobs For Americans\\nCALLER No. 4\\nMODERATOR: This is “Ask President Carter” on the CBS Radio Network. Now, to call the President here in the Oval Office in Washington, let us remind you of the telephone number again. It's 900‐242‐1611. 900‐242‐1611. And the next call, Mr. President, is from Miss Cheryl Clark, of Paris, Ky. Miss Clark.\\nQ. Mr. President, this Is Cheryl Clark, a student at the University of Kentucky. I'd like to ask, do you consider it possible for Government to create jobs similar to the W.P.A. and the C.C.C. in the Depression years in order to reduce unemployment, or do you support the Humphrey‐Hawkins Bill?\\nA. Well the first major proposal that I made to the Congress, which was worked out with the Congressional leaders even before I was inaugurated, was to put the American people back to work or to start that process. I think this is one of the primary responsibilities that I have as President. We've asked for a so‐called stimulation package to our economy over the next two years—this one and next year—of about $31 billion, a major portion of which is either reducing people's taxes or providing direct jobs.\\nThe jobs can be provided in a number of ways, including the one that you describe for young people, similar to the C.C.C. program we had during the Depression years back in the Thirties.\\nIn addition to that, we have approved as far as my Administration is concerned, a substantial amount of money for public works projects—that is, to build libraries, schools and other facilities in communities and that the Federal Government would have to pay for.\\nThis work would be done by those who are employed by private contractors and the same thing would apply in the insulation of homes, in building recreation areas and employment in local and state government, perhaps, and mental institutions, health programs, teachers’ aides, also in the training of primarily young people to hold a full‐time job in the private sector.\\nAnd the total cost of this, as I said, is about $31 billion. And I think this is the best approach to it.\\nThe Humphrey‐Hawkins Bill is pretty much a philosophical kind of expression of our Government's commitment to full employment. The HumphreyHawkins Bill has been constantly modified: it's never gotten out of committee either In the House or Senate. And I think some of the things that we propose this year are a substitute for some of the provisions of the HumphreyHawkins Bill.\\nI do feel, In closing that most of the job opportunities ought to be generated permanently and in the private sector of our free enterprise system and not in Government itself. And that would be the result, I hope, of this two‐year effort to stimulate an economy which is very dormant now and where the unemployment rate and inflation rate is excessively high.\\nQ. Okay, thank you very much.\\nA. Thank you, Cheryl.\\nQ. You'll see public confidence in Government increase.\\nA. Thank you.\\nQ. Goodbye.\\nFamily Costs In White House\\nCALLER NO. 5\\nMODERATOR: The next call, Mr. President, is from Nick Kniska of Lanham, Md.\\nQ. Mr. President?\\nA. Yes.\\nQ. My question for you is that I would like to know why your son Chip and your daughter‐in‐law and grandson are living in the White House on taxpayers’ money, why he is not out in his own house earning a living, O.K., instead of living off the taxpayers.\\nA. Well, I think you might want to know that all of the personal expenses of our family are paid for out of my own pocket or the pocket of my children. Our food is kept separate; we pay for all of it. All of our clothes and so forth are paid for out of our own pocket.\\nChip is a hard‐working young man and he's a great help to me. Most of my first year in office will be spent fairly close to the White House, and when we have a special problem anywhere in the nation and I want the people there to know how deeply concerned I an about it, I would like to have an opportunity to use members of my family to go and represent me personally, along with professionals who serve in the government.\\nI'll just give you one quick example that involves Chip directly. When we had a very serious problem in Buffalo because of excessive snowfall, I asked Chip to go up there to speak for me. He's a very knowledgeable young man and he also let the Buffalo people know that I personally cared about them. I couldn't take a full day off and go and spend a day in Buffalo, but Chip could. So I think this is a good approach.\\nBut I want you and the American people to know that we are not mooching off the American taxpayers. All of our family's expenses are paid for out of my own pocket.\\nQ. O.K, this Is a follow‐up.\\nA. Sure.\\nQ. In the last week or so you had your grandson born in a naval hospital?\\nA. Yes.\\nQ. O.K., is he entitled to special military benefits or Government benefits also?\\nA. No, sir.\\nQ. O.K., then why were they in a military hospital?\\nA. Well, Bethesda Hospital is available for all top officials and their families.\\nQ. Yes. Because we're a military family, too.\\nA. Very good. Well, I was an old military man myself.\\nQ. Yes.\\nA. But we have health insurance and we pay the routine charges for the hospital expenses. I might say, though, in complete honesty with you, that there is a physician who is attached to the White House and who always has been. And he follows me when I go somewhere in case I get hurt or have a heart attack or something. And his services are available to the members of my family as well.\\nQ. O.K. So in other words that's where he sent them.\\nA. That's correct. Now he's not an obstetrician but he is available in case I or any of my family members—or even guests in the White House—get ill during the night. He's available to take care of them and that's done at public expense.\\nQ. O.K., thank you very much, Mr. President.\\nA. Sure.\\nQ. O.K., goodbye.\\nA. Goodbye, Nick.\\nSeeking Reform In U.S. Tax Law\\nCALLER No. 6\\nMODERATOR. Mrs. Esther Thomas of Villanova, Pa., Mr. President, is on the phone. Go ahead, Mrs. Thomas.\\nQ. Good afternoon, Mr. President. First I'd like to say as a mother of an American officer in the United States Army, career officer, I hope you go into history books as the first Democratic President that did not solve our nation's financial and unemployment problems by going to war. Now for my question. How can we, as middleclass earners, expect legislation or reform that would remove tax loopholes the rich or affluent use as deductions when all laws and legislation are made by the rich? There are no poor people, no lower‐class wage earners in either the House or the Senate.\\nA. Well, Mrs. Thomas, I think you may have noticed during the campaign that I made an issue of this almost constantly and in my acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention said that I thought the income tax system of this country was a disgrace. I haven't changed my opinion about that and have initiated a comprehensive analysis of the income tax structure, and before the end of September we will propose to the American people and the Congress in a highly publicized way basic reforms in the income tax structure.\\nIn the stimulation package that I mentioned earlier this afternoon, we have one provision in there that helps people like yourselves. It increases the personal exemption for a family up to $3,000, and this is a permanent change and also greatly simplifies the income tax forms, which, as you notice for 1976 calendar year that you are filling out now, are very complicated.\\nQ. And how.\\nA. Now this average for a family, for instance, that makes $10,000 a year —this tax reduction or refund will amount to about 30 percent of the taxes paid. And the permanent reduction that will be in effect from now on will amount to about 20 percent tax reduction for that $10,000‐a‐year family. We anticipate in September eliminating a great number of the loopholes that do benefit the rich and the powerful, and any of those savings that are derived from that will be passed along to the low and middle‐income families like, perhaps, yourself.\\nQ. Thank you. And may I say as a registered Republican, I'm behind you 100 percent, and I'm sure there's a lot of us out here.\\nA. Thank you ma'am. I really appreciate that.\\nQ. Thank you. Goodbye.\\nMODERATOR: Mr. President, what\\nabout Mrs. Thomas's question about the Congress being loaded with the upper‐middle classes and upper classes and not enough representation from the lower classes. Do you think that's true?\\nA. Well, I think once a Congressman gets in office now with a fairly substantial salary, they are obviously in the upper class, and so is a President, by the way. I guess so is an anchorman for CBS.\\nBut I think that to the extent that Government officials like myself and the members of Congress make an extra effort to stay in touch with people to let folks like Mrs. Thomas ask us questions and to scrutinize who pays the bills for my family within the White House anti so forth—that's a good way to restore confidence in us.\\nAlso I believe that the campaigns which come every two years for the members of Congress keep them in touch with poor or working people. I know my own campaign for the last two years, joined by my wife and all my sons and their wives, my mother quite often and my sister and my aunt, we learned about people in other parts of the country outside of Georgia during the two‐year period. So the campaign process is part of our Constitu tional system. I believe there's a good guarantee that ‘to a substantial degree, public officials stay in touch with folks back home.\\nNow the problem is, Walter, in a case like income tax, over a period of years the laws change, and the ones who demand the changes are those who are powerful and who are influential and who can hire lobbyists or who can pay for their own private lawyer and who can form a cohesive approach to Congress and put tremendous pressure on the Congress to meet a permanent or transient temporary need. Once that need is passed, that special privilege in the law stays there.\\nThe average American family, 510,000, $15,000 sometimes $20,000 a year, has no organization. They don't have any lobbyists, and the only way for them to understand what goes on in very complicated income tax laws is for somebody like the President to take the initiative and present to the American people in a comprehensive way all at once these are the things that are unfair. These are the things that can be changed to make it fair so the American people can be marshalled to exert their influence and their interest in the laws.\\nA person who has a special privilege, they focus their attention and their influence on that one tiny part of the law and the average American has no idea what's going on. But if I can get the whole American tax‐paving body toward the end of September to join with me and demand from the Congress that we make the laws simple and fair, then in that instance I think we can overcome this deterioration, which in my opinion, has taken place ever since 1913 or whenever it was that the income tax laws went into effect. And that's why I'm. so interested in having the American people not only believe that I'm acting for them but let them understand what's going on. That's the reason for this radio broadcast.\\nBetter View Of Farmers\\nCALLER No. 7\\nMODERATOR: The next caller is on the line, Mr. President. Its Mrs. Harlan Schnuhl of Brandon, Wis,\\nQ. Good afternoon, Mr. President.\\nA. Good afternoon.\\nQ. I would like to compliment you on giving the opportunity to the American people to participate in this question‐and‐answer period. As a wife of a dairy farmer, my question relates to a problem concerning many such farmers.\\nWhat can be done about improving the public relations between the consuming public and the U. S. Ag Department in regards to the price increases for farm commodities at our farm level and the explanation to the public that we as farmers receive a small amount of these widely acclaimed increases.\\nA. I've got two quick suggestions: One is to put a farmer in the White House, and the other is to put an actual dirt farmer in the Department of Agriculture as the Secretary, and we've already done those two things\\nAlso I think the next step is to let the American public know the truth about agriculture and the farm and ranch families of our nation. I think that the interests of consumers and the interest of the average farm family are exactly the same. I have studied the Wisconsin dairy farm industry quite at length myself during the Wisconsin primary last year. The average Wisconsin dairy family only makes about $7,000 a year, and that's with all the members of the family working on the farm—maybe three, four or more adults. There's an investment, an average investment, in the Wisconsin dairy farm of about $180,000, so if the farm is sold and the money was put in a savings account at 5 percent interest, the Wisconsin dairy family would have an income of $9,000 a year just from the interest, which is $2,000 more than they get from working full time on the dairy farm.\\nQ. Correct.\\nA. And if the American consumers who drink milk and eat cheese and other dairy products know for a fact that the farmers are not making excessive profits, that they work very hard seven days a week and that the return on their investment is extremely low, like 3 or 4 percent, I think they would appreciate what the farmers do, and I think a stable farm economy where the prices of milk are at least equal to production cost would guarantee that you don't have the wild fluctuations up and down in milk and wheat and cotton and beef and poultry and pork, because when the prices fluctuate wildly because the market is uncontrolled, when they go, the consumers pay the high price; the farmers have already sold their products to the middle man, and when the prices go down for the farmer, for the consumer they stay up.\\nSo what we are trying to do is to have a stable farm economy with predictable production as well as the weather will let us. with prices that don't fluctuate wildly and with the truth being told the consumers that what's best for them is almost always exactly what's best for the average farm or ranch family. So I think we're making some progress in that. I might close my answer by saying that in 1977, this year, there will be a comprehensive farm bill either passed or extended from the past number of years, so we'll be addressing this on a fulltime basis, and Bob Bergland, who is a dirt farmer from the northern part of Minnesota and now the Secretary of Agriculture, I think we'll have a much better way to understand both farmers and consumers than has been done in the past.\\nQ. Well, thank you so much for your comments.\\nA. Thank you, Mrs. Schnuhl.\\nDividends Tax Is Called Unfair\\nCALLER No. S\\nMs. Rita Karatjas, Joliet, Ill.\\nQ. Yes. Good afternoon, President Carter.\\nA. Good afternoon.\\nQ. I would like to know if you intend to remove the tax on savings account interest and stock dividends? I believe we're one of the only countries in the world that tax unearned income. And I feel that as income is already taxed at the payroll level, I feel it very unfair that it's taxed again after it's invested or saved.\\nA. Mrs. Karatjaz, I can't answer that question yet. I'm not trying to avoid your question, I just don't know the answer.\\nQ. I see.\\nA. That's one of the things that we will be considering along with hundreds and hundreds of others in the comprehensive tax reform study that will be going on this year.\\nSo I'm reluctant now to single out one particular part of the tax code and say it will not be changed, even though it might very well stay the same. I just can't answer your question now.\\nQ. I see.\\nA. I'm sorry.\\nQ. Thank you.\\nCALLER NO. 9\\nMODERATOR: Next questioner. Ronald Fousc, or Fouse I believe it is, of Centreville, Ga., Mr. President. Mr. Fouse,\\nQ. Good afternoon, Mr. President.\\nA. Afternoon, Mr. Fouse. I came to Centreville the last time I was home.\\nQ. Yes, sir, you come through the Air Force base I work at every time you come down.\\nA. Very fine. Go ahead with your question.\\nQ. Yes, sir. Now that you've pardoned the draft evaders and you propose to pardon the junkies and deserters, do you propose to do anything for the veterans such as myself that served the country with loyalty?\\nA. Well, I thought I might get a friendlier question from Georgia, but I'll try to answer your question.\\nT don't intend to pardon any more people from the Vietnam era. I promised the American people when I was running for office that I would pardon the ones who violated the Selective Service laws; I don't have any apology to make about it and think 1 made the right decision.\\nBut the deserters and others who've committed crimes against military law or civilian law will not be pardoned by me on any sort of blanket basis. My preference is to let the Defense Department handle those cases by categories or by individual cases.\\nWe have moved, I think, already, to help—as you said—loyal and patriotic veterans like yourself. And I've appointed a very fine young man to head up the Veterans Administration now, Max Cleland, who is a veteran of the Vietnam War. This is kind of a new generation of leadership.\\nAnd within the economic package that I presented to Congress we have a heavy emphasis on training and job opportunities for veterans. So I hope in the future that we can have a restoration in our country of appreciation for veterans who did go to the Vietnam Transcript of Carter Call‐In Continued War, who have not been thanked or appreciated enough in the past, and a much more sensitive Veterans Administration toward the Vietnam veterans who have not had as many benefits as veterans of previous wars that were more popular.\\nBut I don't have any apology to make for what I have done, but you need not be concerned about an extension of pardons on a blanket basis in the future from me.\\nQ. O.K., sir, thank you very much. A. Thank you.\\nMODERATOR: Mr. President, there seems to be increasing talk about a bonus for Vietnam veterans. Has that been your thinking at all?\\nA. No, sir.\\nStates’ Rights, Women's Rights\\nCALLER NO. 10\\nMODERATOR. The next call is from Mrs. Richard Nicholson of Fort Worth, Texas, Mr. President. Mrs. Nicholson?\\nQ. Mr. President, 1 appreciate this opportunity to talk to you. I feel that you are violating the states’ rights when you call into the different states and lobby for the E.R.A. I was wondering if you—don't you think that this should be left up to the individual state legislators and let them decide without interference from high political offices.\\nA. O.K. Well, I think you probably have noticed that the final decision is with the state legislatures. And although I have made a few telephone calls since I've been in office and have talked to some personally and to some Governors about the passage of E.R.A., I haven't tried to interfere or put pressure on them.\\nWhen I ran for President I made it clear that I was in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment passing and still am in favor of it and hope it does pass. But I respect very well and very consistently the right of individual state legislators to vote the way they choose.\\nBut I think it's good to point out to the legislators individually and to the people of the country as I am doing at this moment that we do need to give women equal rights. They've been cheated too long. They don't have equal pay for equal jobs and I think that this Equal Rights Amendment, which is very simple and very clear, would be a good thing for our country.\\nSo I don't have any way to make a legislator vote against his or her wishes. I don't want any influence on them, but reserve the right to express my opinion just like you have a right to express yours.\\nQ. Except that I don't have the power to make or break someone that you do.\\nA. T don't have that power, either, Miss Nicholson.\\nQ. O.K. Now that'd he all right. Nowhere does it mention anything about women's rights. And there is the equal pay opportunity which is already a law, that is being used, so how can the E.R.A. help in these two areas?\\nA. I think the Equal Rights Amendment just simply says that the Congress nor any state are not permitted to discriminate against women. And I would presume that you would agree with that statement, but apparently you don't.\\nQ. Well certainly I do.\\nMODERATOR: Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Nicholson.\\nA. Thank you, ma'am.\\nQ. Thank you.\\nAmount of Help For Taxpayers\\nCALLER NO. 11\\nMODERATOR: Thank you.\\nLet's do move on. We want to get as many questioners in as possible today. Mike McGrath of Warsaw, Ind., has won the lottery to get on the air here. Mr. McGrath, go ahead with your question to President Carter.\\nQ. Yes, sir, Mr. President, sir. Are you there?\\nA. Yes, sir, go right ahead, Mike.\\nQ. O.K. A little quotation now—I was awful proud to serve in the Vietnam War there. I was aboard that U.S.S. Constellation there, there in North Vietnam, there.\\nA. Yes.\\nQ. But at any rate, Is that there tax rebate supposed to be for $50, or, or what?\\nA. I think it will be more than $50 for some people, depending on what your income is.\\nQ. Oh.\\nA. The ones that make above $25,000 or $30,000 a year don't get any rebate, according to the latest action of the Congress, and that means that a little bit more would be available to those at the lower levels of income.\\nQ. Oh.\\nA. In addition to that, there's a special provision for allocation of funds to veterans, like yourself, and in addition we have a tax reduction that's permanent by giving a higher personal exemption of $3,000 for a married couple—I think the latest version is $2.400 for a single person—so you get about a, an equivalent of a 30 percent reduction in your income taxes for 1976, ifou're at the $10,000 or so level.\\nQ. You mean it might be a little bit lower than that?\\nA. Well, if you have a real high Income like you seem to have, you might get a little bit lower, but it won't be much lower than 50,000, than $50 in the tax rebate unless you are well above the $25,000 level, and in addition, as I said, you'll get the permanent reduction in your income taxes brought about by the higher personal exemption. That'll stay on the books even after the stimulation package is gone.\\nQ. Oh, O.K.\\nA. It's a pretty good deal for you, I think.\\nQ. I think so. Now, another thing was, there's somebody told me at the factory where I work at, that Peabody, American Brands, somebody told me that the G.I. Bill is supposed to have been reactivated or something? Is there anything to that at all?\\nA. Mike, I don't know about the latest version of that, but if you'll listen in on the radio program for the next 10 or 15 minutes, I'll get the answer for you and give it to you in a few minutes. Okay?\\nQ. That's fine, O.K., that's fine. Thank you, Mr. President.\\nA. Thank you, Mike.\\nMODERATOR: I might note that the President has a plan for just that—if he doesn't have the answer here, he's got a couple of aides standing by to see if they can get them. It is Saturday afternoon, a lot of government offices are closed, but he's going to do his best to get them for you.\\nA. I might say, Walter, that if I can't find the answer before we go off the air, I'll call Mike personally, Monday, and give him the answer if I can.\\nCALLER NO. 12\\nMODERATOR: Let's remind all of our listeners out there that the toll‐free number to reach the President here at the White House is 900‐242‐1611, 900242‐1611. Now, Mr. President, we have a young man, 13 years old, I'm told, in Ridgecrest, Calif., John Herold, who has a question for you. John, go ahead. Q. Good afternoon, Mr. President. A. Good afternoon, John. How are things in California?\\nQ. Fine.\\nA. Good deal. What's your question?\\nQ. Since the West is having a drought and the East has too much snow, instead of shifting the snow in boxcars to the South, why not ship it West?\\nS. Well, we're not shipping snow South in boxcars. I think somebody made a study of that, John, and found that it would be too expensive to try to ship snow to the West.\\nWe are very concerned about your drought. And I know that you're—I'm not sure how far north Ridgecrest is, but I know that there's an appeal by your Governor not to waste water. And I believe that in the future, along with energy conservation, we're going to have to start worrying about water conservation.\\nWe've had too much snow in the East. Most of it's melted already, so we don't have any snow to ship even if it wasn't very expensive. That's a good thought though, and it was investigated quite thoroughly, I think, a couple of weeks ago when Buffalo, for instance, had accumulated about four or five feet of snow.\\nGood luck to you, John, and thanks for calling in.\\nQ. Thank you.\\nBetter Benefits Under Medicare\\nCALLER NO. 13\\nMODERATOR: The next call is from Mrs. Helen Heller of Vineland, N.J.\\nQ. Good afternoon, Mr. President.\\nA. Good afternoon, Mrs. Heller.\\nQ. Thank you for this opportunity to talk to you. My question concerns\\nthe Medicare program. Does H.E.W. have any plan to re‐evaluate this program with the possibility of extending benefits to senior citizens so as to reimburse them for things like needed dental care, eyeglasses and their medications? The cost of these items are so often beyond our fixed Social Security income and yet they're vital necessities to us.\\nA. Yes, ma'am. those things are all under consideration. We are now in the process of reorganizing the internal structure of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare so that we can put the financing of health care under one administrator. This will help a great deal to cut down on the cost of those items for people like yourself.\\nAlso we are freezing the amount of money that you'd have to pay for Medicare this coming year. Although the price of health care has gone up about 15 percent a year the last few years, we're trying to prevent your monthly payments from going up for this corning year.\\nQ. Yes, that's good.\\nA. Additionally, we have introduced into the Congress a bill that would hold down hospital costs and try to prevent health care costs from going up faster than other parts of our economy. There's been a great deal of maladministration, or poor administration, of the health cost. I hope that over a period of years—and it's not going to come easily—that we can have a comprehensive health care plan in our country.\\nIt will be very expensive, but the first step has got to be to bring some order out of chaos in the administration of the health problems we've already got, and to help poorer people—like perhaps yourself, I don't know what your income is—be able to prevent rapidly increasing costs of programs like Medicare.\\nSo we are at least freezing your Medicare costs if the Congress goes along with our proposal. And over a period of years we'll try to expand the coverage of the health care services for all citizens like you.\\nQ. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President.\\nCALLER NO. 14\\nMODERATOR: The next caller is Miss Phyllis Dupere of Rehoboth, Mass. Miss Dupere, the President's on the line.\\nQ. Hello, Mr. President.\\nA. Good afternoon, Phyllis.\\nQ. I'm a recent graduate from college and I majored in science and my question is about the space shuttle program. If you had the opportunity to go on one of the missions, would you go and why or why not?\\nMODERATOR: You're talking about a space mission, Miss Dupere.\\nQ. The space shuttle program.\\nA. Oh, I see. Miss Dupere, I'm probably too old to do that. I don't know if I could start now and train and get ready to go. When I was a younger person I was always very eager to do the most advanced and sometimes quite dangerous things. As soon as our country had the idea of having atomic power to propel submarines I was one of the first ones to volunteer and was one of the very earliest submarine officers to go into the atomic power program.\\nAnd I am thinking about in the next few weeks going with Admiral Rickover out on one of our atomic submarines to ride on that. As a President it's part of my duty to learn about things of that kind.\\nBut I can't tell you that I'm ready to go on a space shuttle. I think I just don't have the time to get ready for it.\\nI might say that my sons would like very much to do it, but not me.\\nQ. Do you think your daughter would?\\nA. I think perhaps she would, yes. She's a very innovative young lady and is always trying for new things and I think she's competent to be a pilot in a space shuttle in the future or to be a member of Congress, or even to be President, yes, ma'am.\\nQ. O.K., thank you. Goodbye.\\nMODERATOR: You know, Mr. President, with that shirtsleeve environment, so‐called, of the shuttle, they're holding out a little hope that some of us fellows may get a chance to go along.\\nA. I'm interested in that program, by the way. I think this is going to be a much cheaper means by which we can perform our very valuable flights in space and still return the costly vehicle back to earth. I'm very interested in that.\\nMODERATOR:It's going to mean the utilization of space. We're getting past the exploration stage, I think, now.\\nA. We are using it now. And I think, as you probably know, with space satellite photography we not only guarantee the security of our country, but we do a great deal of analysis of crop conditions, topographical mapping to see how far it is between places, highway planning, and this is a good way, too, by the way, from either high‐flying airplanes or space, to analyze waste of energy, to see where we are not insulating adequately, etc.\\nAnd so for all those reasons, even things that are very common, like growing crops, or mining or building highways or cutting down on heat losses. we are already using space vehicles for those purposes.\\nGetting Away From Pressures\\nCALLER NO. 15\\nMODERATOR: The next telephone call is from Ms. Susan Allen of Chevenne, Wyo., Mr. President.\\nQ: Yes, Mr. President?\\nA: Yes, Susan.\\nQ: O.K., my question is: When you're President, do you ever get overwhelmed with your duties and just feel like getting away from it all, and if so, do you have a place to go, you know when you get away from your duties?\\nA: Well, yes, I do, Susan. I felt the same way when I was Governor, and I felt the same way when I was a candidate, and I felt the same way on occasion when I was a farmer, or when I was in the submarine program.\\nI might say that I've enjoyed this first. six weeks of being President. I have a very good staff to help me, and the working conditions are good. My house is close to my office, and I've got a good Cabinet and so far, the American people have been very supportive. I think most people in the country want me to do a good job, and that helps me a lot.\\nI do have a place to get away. We have been down to Georgia on one occasion since I've been in the White House, and while down there my wife and I were able to go out in the woods and in the fields. I like to hunt arrowheads and she and I walked for hours in the open fields looking for arrowheads—just as a hobby—and we have a chance to hold hands, to talk to each other about things all alone.\\nQ: Yeah.\\nA: We've been to Camp David once. It's a beautiful place in the Catoctin Mountains about an hour and a half away from here by automobile. It's a camp that President Roosevelt used when he was President and it's available to Presidents and some of the Cabinet members as well. We've been there on one occasion So we have a chance to get away, and I might add in closing that the White House living quarters on the second and third floor where I and my family live is quite private, and we've enjoyed living there very much.\\nQ: Are you in favor of solar heating?\\nA: Yes, I am. I think this is an area where we need to expand our research and development programs, and I think that in years to come you're going to see in my Administration and from Presidents who come after me a very heavy emphasis on the use of solar power.\\nQ: Yeah, we have a solar house.\\nA: Oh, do you? How does it work?\\nQ: It's worked pretty good so far, but Buffalo and all those places have gotten all the snow, so when we have a chance to we'll check it out in a real big blizzard, but it's been working really good,\\nA: Oh, very good. Thank you very much Ms. Allen.\\nArmy's Plans To Shut Arsenal\\nCALLER NO. 16\\nBob Mitchell, Philadelphia\\nQ. Good afternoon, Mr. President.\\nA. Hi, Bob.\\nQ. How are you?\\nA. Fine.\\nQ. I'd just like to say that this is truly an honor to he speaking to you on this historical occasion. I live in Drexel Hill, Pa., but I work at the Living History Center in Philadelphia, which I'm calling you from today. While visiting Philadelphia just before Election Day, Mr. Mondale pledged to keep the Frankford Arsenal open. The arsenal employs many people in this area and is an important part of our defense system. How can you justify the Army's insistence on closing down this institution, which is both a national necessity and a necessity to this area, which is already overburdened by the economic depression?\\nA. Bob, I might say that if there's one question that the Vice President has talked to me more about than any other thing since I've been in the White House it's been the Frankford Arsenal. And he and I have a deep personal interest in the Frankford Arsenal.\\nUnder the previous administration, the decision had already been made final to close down Frankford. And we are reassessing the possibility of keeping it open, at least in some form.\\nIf it is a final decision by the Defense Department that the arsenal be closed, I'll do everything I can to honor the Vice President's commitment and to try to orient some other kind of Federal project into the Frankford Arsenal area, so that the people will not suffer any more than necessary economically.\\nBut we're doing the best we can on that. The closing‐down had gone so far when I became President, it's almost impossible to reverse it. But we are aware of your problem, and we'll just have to do what I think's best for the country and at the same time try to honor the promise that the Vice President made to do the best he can to keep it open.\\nQ. U.K. Well, thank you, Mr. President.\\nA. Thank you, Bob.\\nQ. Right, bye.\\nWay of Curbing Narcotics Abuse\\nCALLER NO. 17\\nMODERATOR: Mrs. Phyllis Rogers of Albuquerque, N. M., is on the phone, Mr. President. Mrs. Rogers.\\nQ. Good afternoon, President Carter.\\nA. Good afternoon, Mrs. Rogers.\\nQ. Thank you again for the invitationto the Inauguration.\\nA. Did you come?\\nQ. Two questions. Would it be possible to eliminate the word drugs from drug store advertising? Also when new drugs are invented, they always use the word drug. Why not use the terminology medication. Maybe it would discourage drug abuses.\\nA. I think that's a good idea. I was talking yesterday, just coincidentally, Mrs. Rogers, to Dr. Peter Bourne, who is now the head of my entire drug control effort, and he will be working with foreign countries, including your neighbor of Mexico, and with the Congress and others, to try to hold down the abuse of drugs. As you know, this applies not only to the illegal drugs like heroin and cocaine and marijuana and others, but it also applies to some of the medications that you've described. The barbiturates, for instance.\\nThere is a developing question about whether they are necessary at all, and Dr. Bourne pointed out to me that the No. 1 drug that causes death is heroin, and the second is barbiturates, which is a medication that's used quite frequently by medical doctors. So the two are mixed in the people's minds and I think that medication, as you suggested, is a better word.\\nI'm not sure if you could name the dispensers of that, though, medication stores. They might object to that. Maybe there's a better word. Maybe pharmacy would be best. But I don't have any authority over what they name it, but that's a good idea—to separate the two, the illegal drugs from the legal medications, would be a good distinction.\\nQ. Thank you. And the other question is: We are very concerned about the solar energy program here in the State of New Mexico, and we're hoping it will go through for us. Can you comment?\\nA. I don't know what the decision will he. I don't intend to get involved in the decision personally. I would like to see the research and development programs for solar energy be decided on a merit basis and where the installations are best. I would say, though, that New Mexico has a head start on many of the places around the country because of the long history of research and development and because of your climate. But I think we'll have several places around the country. But we will be doing an increasing amount of research and development on solar energy in the future.\\nQ. We love you, President Carter, and thank you very much.\\nA. Thank you very, very much yourself. I've just gotten an answer, by the way,  that I'd like to give as well as I can to Mike McGrath from Warsaw, Ind. regarding the G.I. Bill.\\nPresident Forci had recommended terminated benefits tinder the G.I. Bill for all persons who entered military service after Jan. 1, 1977. He wanted to cut the period of eligibility for veterans who had entered military service before this time from 10 years to eight years. During the campaign I came out against these actions and supported strengthening of the G.I. Bill and to hold to the 10‐year period of eligibility. In the budget that I just put into the of benefits so the 10‐year period will remain for Vietnam veterans for the G.I. Bill. So that answer, I think, is a good one for Mike, and I hope that he's still on the air to listen to it.\\nAppeal to End Ban on Laetrile\\nCALLER NO. 18\\nMODERATOR: We'll remind you that to reach the President here in the Oval Office of the White House, the number to call is 900‐242‐1611. In some areas there is an access code for long distance. If there is, why you use it and then you dial 900‐242‐1611. And having successfully done that, Mrs. Opal Dehart of Trinity, N. C.\\nA. Good afternoon, Miss Dehart.\\nQ. Good afternoon, President Carter, I'm happy to have the opportunity to speak with you.\\nA. Well, it's nice to talk to folks from North Carolina. You got a question for me?\\nQ. Well. I really have more of a statement to make and a request.\\nA. O.K.\\nQ. My father has terminal cancer. He found out a month ago. He's a hardworking man all his life and never made much money and doesn't have much now. And for several years I've been reading about Vitamin B17, Laetrile.\\nAnd I feel that the people in this country should be permitted to use this treatment in this country. I realize that the A.M.A. says it's not been proved safe. but for a terminal patient who is not going to live—and has a chance to live with it—I don't see how it could be dangerous.\\nAnd hospital insurance does not cover treatment not authorized by the A.M.A. And most hard‐working people in this country cannot afford treatments if not made under insurance benefits.\\nAnd if a person has money available to leave the country for treatment in one of the 17 countries where cancer specialists use this successfully, they have a chance of recovery. And a lot of people even from my area have done this.\\nWhat T want to say is that we need your help, and the government's help, in checking this vitamin out so that it's made available to the American people.\\nA. All right, Mrs. Dehart. I might let someone from the Department of H.E.W. give you a call Monday and talk to about it further. You didn't ask me a question, but I've heard about the controversy. I know that in some of our neighboring countries—I think Mexico—you can buy the Laetrile and be treated with it.\\nQ. That's right.\\nA. Why don't you let me have someone call you Monday, if you don't mind. It wouldn't help much if I called you because I don't know—I'm not a medical doctor, I'm not familiar with it. Would that suit you O.K.?\\nQ. Yes, sir, it would. I just wanted you to be aware and maybe that something could be done. There's an investigation needed. I know that right now it's mainly because of the 1953 ban in the state of California, and that's a little outdated and has not been tested. And the doctors who signed the papers at that time had not tested it. They went on somebody else's word.\\nMODERATOR: Well, thank you Mrs. Dehart. I know the President is going to have you called on that. It is a matter that concerns a lot of people in the United States.\\nMR. CARTER. Yes. Walter, I might say that one of the things that concerned the medical profession in permitting the use of a drug that might not be harmful—and may not do any good, either one—is that it sometimes causes people not to seek treatment because they're depending on a worthless drug.\\nI'm not trying to make a judgment on this one, but I know that that's a concern to us.\\nCALLER NO. 19\\nMODERATOR: Mr. O. B. Parris of Vinemont, Ala., on the phone, Mr. President. Mr. Parris?\\nQ. Yes, Mr. President. I'm Red Parris with Gulf Oil, I'm a jobber for Gulf Oil Company, here in Cullman, Alabama, also Goodlet Construction Company, and I was wondering how you feel on the vertical divestiture of the oil companies, vertical and horizontal divestiture of the oil companies.\\nA. The position that I took during the campaign, Mr. Parris, is the same one that I have now. I think as a general proposition, vertical integration of major industries is nothing, is not contrary to the best interests of American people, provided you have a continued and adequate competition.\\nI am concerned on two ends of the vertical integration process. One is that there be an insured competition for leasing rights. I think it would be a mistake for us though to require a dif‐\\nferent company to drill for oil, to extract the oil from the ground, to pump the oil to a refinery, to do the refining, and then to distribute it and then to wholesale it and then to retail it. If different companies had to do all those processes, I think that the price of the final product, like gasoline, would be greatly increased, because of inefficiency.\\nQ. That is true.\\nA. I think at the wholesale and retail level, there have been occasions that I have witnessed when there has been an inadequate amount of competition, and sometimes the small and independent service station operators have been forced to shift toward the maiors, and this particularly did occur in the initial stages of the 1973 embargo period.\\nI have a concern also about horizontal investments when the major oil companies acquire over a period of time a controlling interest in, say, coal mining operations. It means, quite often, that there is not a heavy enough emphasis placed on increasing coal production.\\nSo at the wholesale and retail level, I have some concern, and in the horizontal investment by oil companies like in coal or uranium, I have some concern, unless I'm convinced that there's adequate competition there. I would be in favor of considering divestiture, but my first preference would be to insure competition through the antitrust laws and disclosure of profits at the individual levels of the vertical integration rather than divestiture itself.\\nQ. Yes, sir. Thank you very much.\\nA. Thank you, Mr. Parris.\\nFinding Controls For Coffee Price\\nCALLER NO. 20\\nMODERATOR: The next caller is Mr. Dale Butkovitz of Peru, Ill. Mr. Butkovitz.\\nQ. Yes, good afternoon, Mr. President.\\nA. Good afternoon, Dale.\\nQ. Yes, I have a question here. This relates with this recent coffee situation. My question is: Can we see any prospect of lower imported commodities on such as coffee, and if so, how can we go about it?\\nA. Is you name pronounced But‐ko'vitz or But'‐kovitz?\\nQ. But‐ko'‐vitz.\\nA. I don't know how to answer your question about the future. As you know, the Brazilians and other coffeeproducing countries claim that the drought—or freeze, I think it was—destroyed a number of the coffee trees and that's the reason for the high prices. I think there are adequate reserves on hand now, but the future crops of coffee are likely to be vary short and the prospect of short es have forced up the price.\\nI don't know how to deal with this. There's no way for us to control the price of coffee that comes in from Colombia, or Brazil or Costa Rica to our country—to our own nation. I think that we have one opportunity, as consumers, and that is to drink less coffee as the price goes up. This is almost inevitable in a free‐enterprise system.\\nI'm here for two hours without moving and, just coincidentally. I'm drinking hot tea now instead of coffee. I don't want us to put an embargo on coffee use, hut I don't know how to answer your question any better than that. I don't know what the future holds. I don't think that we can do anything to control the price of coffee except to reduce consumption.\\nQ. Mr. President?\\nA. Yes, Dale.\\nQ. God bless you and I wish you all continued success. You're doing a fine job.\\nA. Thank you very much, Dale, that was nice of you.\\nDisabled Oppose A Tax Revision\\nCALLER NO. 21\\nMODERATOR: Now let's take another call. It's from Mr. Phillip Roche, Tooele, Utah. Mr. Phillip Roche Tooele of—or Mr. Phillip Roche of Tooele, Utah. Let's go through it once more, Mr. President. We might as well spend the afternoon with this: Mr. Phillip Roche of Tooele, Utah.\\nQ. That's Too‐ella.\\nMODERATOR: All right. Tank you, sir. It is Ro‐shay', though, is it?\\nQ. It is Ro‐shay,’ yes sir.\\nMODERATOR: I got that much right.\\nA. Phillip, go ahead with your question.\\nQ. Mr. President, are you familiar with the sick leave portion of the 1976 income tax revision?\\nA. What was the first part of the—I heard the 1976 income tax revision—what's the first part?\\nQ. The sick leave portion of the 1976 income tax revision.\\nA. Yes, I'm fairly familiar with it.\\nQ. Well, my question is this, Mr. President: Are those that can't qualify for their Federal medical retirement now, could they possibly be given their jobs back?\\nA. I don't know.\\nQ. The 1976 income tax revision changed the agreement to which these people retired at, and by changing the agreements, people making $300 and $400 a month are going to have to come up with four, five, six hundred dollars for their 1976 income tax due to a clause in that sick leave portion.\\nA. Mr. Roche, perhaps Walter could answer that question. I don't know, but I'll have my staff see if I can get the answers, and if I can't give it to you on this program, I'll give you a call Monday and try to answer your question.\\nQ. (Mrs. Roche) That would be great. But Mr. President.\\nA. Yes, ma'am\\nQ. We were allowed formerly—the truly disabled ones were allowed, you know—up to $100 a week tax deducton if they were truly disabled. Well, even though they're truly disabled now, this new revision has taken away that exclusion.\\nMODERATOR: Well, I tell you—I gather that's Mrs. Roche, is it?\\nQ. (Mr. Roche) That's the boss.\\nMODERATOR: Well, I tell you, the President's going to look up this question for you. It's a rather complicated one. He's going to see if he can get an answer for you and get back to you. The question's almost as difficult as pronouncing Tooele, or Tooele.\\nA. (Mr. Roche) Tooele.\\nMODERATOR: Tooele. Thank you. Thank you very much, Roches. Glad to talk to both of you.\\nCARTER. I'll call you back personally Monday and talk to you then. O.K.\\nTax on Couples, Costly Housing\\nCALLER NO. 22\\nMODERATOR: Now Mr. Charles Stone, Mr. President, of Dallas, Texas.\\nQ: Two questions, sir: Having recently completed figuring the income tax for my fiance and myself, the tax difference was $1,000 between single and married. When and what action do you plan to take? Also, in the news, you recently stated that the cost of a new home was out of reach for most Americans. Is there anything that can be done about the price or the interest rate?\\nA: Mr. Stone, the only thing that I know of that can cut down the price of interest rates would be to control inflation, and we have been working for the last six weeks on a comprehensive approach so that we would know in Washington, and so the American people can be informed, about all the things that we do that cause an increase in interest rates.\\nIn addition, for low income families, or middle income families, we're trying to stimulate housing construction by helping with the repayment of your mortgage on a monthly basis. I hope to increase the amount of guaranteed loans for people like yourselves, and I hope this will be a lot of help to you in the years to come. We've increased the authorization for home construction by between $8 billion and $9 billion, which is an awful lot of money—of course that extends over 40 years in the future.\\nTo answer your first question, I would like to see in a tax reform package a removal as much as possible of any sort of tax advantage for either single people or married people. This is a complicated question, and 1 don't know how to deal with it. We have now in some parts of the income tax laws, a fairly substantial reward for people who live in the same house but who are not married, and I would like to remove that, but at the same time let people who are single and who live alone, not as married people, not be punished.\\nSo that's one of the complicated questions that has always been a matter of debate, both in the state and national legislatures. I don't know how to give the answer yet, but there is a great disparity now.\\nQ. Yes, sir, you will have an answer, I believe you said, in September in your tax package.\\nA. I hope so. We're going to address that issue, and I hope we can come up with a reasonable answer. We're going to complete the study of this entire tax code, which is enormously complicated, as you know, and the deadline that I've established and the Secretary of the Treasury, Mike Blumenthal, is the lead Cabinet officer on it, has agreed that we can complete this study and make our recommendations to the people and to the Congress by Sept. 30. yes.\\nQ. Very good. Thank you, sir.\\nA. Good luck to you.\\nMODERATOR: Did I understand you to say there that you would penalize ttnmarrieds living together?\\nA. No, I just don't think there ought to be an advantage between married people and the unmarried people who share the same household. I'd like to remove, if possible, any advantage one way or the other, Walter.\\nCALLER NO. 23\\nMODERATOR: Mrs. John Ritchey is on the phone, Mr. President. She's in Georgetown, Ky. Mrs. Ritchey?\\nQ. Thank you Walter. Good afternoon, Mr. President. I am part American Indian and am a descendant of the Ottawa tribe of northern Michigan. We presently have a bill in the Senate, Bill No. 1659. This was awarding us payment for sale of land to the Government. But the Government is once again dragging its feet, you know, for fire services and things like this. I would like to know if you're aware of this bill and if you can help us in any way. This originally started in 1870 as a signed treaty. There was a partial payment made in 1910, but since then, nothing.\\nA. The answer to your first question is easy. And the answer is no, I'm not familiar with the bill. The answer, if it will help you or not, I'll help to this degree. I will look into the bill and see what I think is a right and a fair thing to do. If it seems to me that the particular Indian group to which you refer has not been treated fairly, then through the Department of Interior and the Attorney General, I'll give you what help is proper. And I'll either be back in touch with you this coming week, or let one of my staff members call you back and see what we think about the legislation that you have described. O.K.?\\nQ. O.K. This is something, you know, that we have worked on with our ancestors, you know. They've all died and, you know, this is something that they've talked about, and these are hopes and dreams that have never been fulfilled.\\nA. I understand. Well, I think as you probably know in Maine and Massachusetts and several places around further West and South, there's a great new analysis of whether or not Indians have been treated fairly and legally in the past. And I would believe that I and the Congress would want to treat your ancestors or their descendants, including youself, fairly about it; but I'll look into the bill personally and let you hear from me or my staff about it.\\nQ. O.K. Thank you, sir.\\nA. Thanks for calling.\\nCALLER NO. 2.1\\nMODERATOR: Next call, Mr. President, is from the Rev. James Baker in Ridgeland, S.C.\\nft. Good afternoon, Mr. President.\\nA. Good afternoon.\\nQ. First, sir, 1 would like to commend you for the effort that you have made to restore ethics and morality in government. I think you've taken a splen‐\\nCleric Dies After Talk On Phone With Carter\\nCOLUMBIA, S. C., March 5 (AP)—A minister died of a heart attack today shortly after talking to President Carter on the President's call‐in program.\\n“He talked to the President and passed away,” his wife said.\\nThe Rev. James Baker, 56, talked to President Carter about 2:15 P.M., then suffered a heart attack. He was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead at 4:40 P.M.\\n“He was very elated and delighted to have talked to the President and was looking forward to seeing it on TV,” the minister's wife, Louise, said.\\nMr. Baker, like the President, was a Baptist. He was pastor of the Robertville Baptist Church in Robertville.\\nIn Washington, a White House spokesman said that President Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, had sent a telegram of condolence to the minister's family. did action in that direction and I wonder if more cannot be done to protect the consumer from shoddy merchandise, or warranties that are not honored, and similar unconscionable profit actions on the part of a minority in our country, either through the Federal Trade Commission or a Consumer Protection Bureau, sort of, set up.\\nA. If I don't do that, Rev. Baker, before I go out of office I will consider my Administration being a failure. You are absolutely right. In many instances the regulatory agencies in Washington have been staffed and led by men and women whose primary interest is not to the consumer at all but to the industries being regulated.\\nSo far we've not been able to get passed the legislation for establishing a consumer protection agency, and the consumers’ interests quite often are supposed to be protected by a little tiny group of people in many dozens, even hundreds, of agencies scattered throughout the City of Washington.\\nSo I'm in favor of the establishment of a Consumer Protection Agency itself to focus the consumers’ interest in one agency as much as possible. This agency would be quite small. I think the budget would be in the neighborhood of $11 million a year for the entire nationwide coverage, and it would let you and I and other people know where to go to register a complaint and it would also have a group of people there whose only interest would be to protect people like you from being cheated.\\nSo I'm strongly in favor of that and I believe that before the next year or two goes by we'll have the new agency in operation. And I wish that you would examine every one of my appointments to these regulatory agencies that have taken place now and that will take place over the next four years, and I believe in every instance you'll see that the people that I do appoint have their obligation to the consumer. And that's the way it should have been in the past.\\nQ. You see the consumer with a small complaint is not able to pay an attorney, naturally, to handle it for him. Where a consumer, you know, has a $25 or $50 complaint, he has nowhere to turn unless he has an agency that can handle it for him. Many of these are poor people.\\nA. You're right. I favor in certain instances the right—increased right of consumers to file class action suitslawsuits—where a thousand consumers who have been cheated can get together and get some relief from unfair trade practices.\\nAnd also on occasion the consumers ought to have an increased right to have legal standing in court, and I think that within the government itself quite often the consumers are not treated farily. That's why I believe it is better to have a separate agency for consumer protection itself.\\nQ. Thank you. You certainly have the prayers of the American public for a successful term of office.\\nA. Thank you, Mr. Baker.\\nMODERATOR: Mr. President, when do you expect to send legislation—a proposal for legislation—to establish a consumer agency up to the Hill?\\nA. Well, the legislation, Walter, as you know, made a lot of progress last year and my own inclination is to support the legislation that was already considered by Congress. And I believe that with the support of the White House instead of the opposition that was the case under the previous Administration, it'll be passed.\\nMODERATOR: You'll support the present legislation as it's now at the Hill, then?\\nA. Yes. I wouldn't want to say that I'll support in any language that's put in it, but if I can approve the basic language I'm strongly in favor of the agency, yes.\\nCALLER NO. 25\\nMODERATOR: The next caller, Mr. President, is John Melfi of Johnson City, N.Y.\\nQ. Gond afternoon, Mr. President.\\nA. Good afternoon, John.\\nQ. I know we have a foreign aid policy to help countries in need, but why do we spend so much on this when we have so much poverty, unemployment and such in our own country?\\nA. Well, John, I'm going to take a position that's not very popular politically speaking. We only spent about three‐tenths of 1 percent of our gross national product on foreign aid, which is about half of the proportion that is allotted to this purpose by other countries like France and Germany and so forth. I don't particularly want to increase this greatly, but I would like for it to be predictable.\\nAlso, in the past we've not had foreign aid used in an effective way. As one of my friends has said quite often, “I'm not in favor of taxing the poor people in our rich country and sending the money to the rich people in the poor countries.” And quite often that's been done in the past.\\nWe have also a need, in my opinion, to support the lending institutions—the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank. They give aid to other countries in the form of loans, sometimes low‐interest loans. But instead of just handing gifts out that are kind of bad as a basic philosophy and also that are abused, I would favor contributing to the capital stock of these international or regional lending agencies. And I believe we'll get a lot better return on our money.\\nAnd I might say that my own experience in this first six weeks has been that the International Monetary Fund, for instance, and the World Bank are quite strict on a nation that makes a loan. They make them work hard toward balancing their budget. Quite often they require them to clean up corruption. They make them assess very carefully their trade policies.\\nSo I believe that the lending procedure in foreign aid is much better than the gift procedure. And when direct grants are made, we ought to do more than we have in the past to get the grants to people who actually need it.\\nWithin those changes. I think that our present level of foreign aid is about right, John.\\nQ. O.K. Thank you, Mr. President. Best of luck to you in the future, and I hope you're there for another eight years.\\nA. Thanks very much.\\nI might say, Walter, that there's a Mr. Otto Flaig of Milwaukee, Wis.: his telephone number, unfortunately for him today, is 242‐1611. And ever since 6 o'clock this morning he's been getting calls from people who want to talk to me, and he has requested me to announce that people please dial the 1 and then the 900 before they dial the 242‐1611 so his phone will quit ringing.\\nMODERATOR: I assume those calls could only get to him from the Milwaukee area, and if they once dial the 900, it won't get through to him at all.\\nA. I'd like to ask people—I guess there are other folks around the country that've got the same last seven numbers, so everybody ought to remember to dial the 900 before the seven.\\nMODERATOR: I wonder if that gentleman in Milwaukee is giving them any answers. Maybe he's giving them quite satisfactory solutions to their problems.\\nA. Yes, I'm sure he's getting a lot of questions. His answers are probably better than mine.\\nDrafting Women For U.S. Service\\nCALLER NO. 26\\nMODERATOR: We have a call from Lapeer, Mich., from Miss Colleen Muir. She's 16 years old, I'm told, Mr. President. Go ahead, Miss Muir.\\nMODERATOR. . . . Muir, I believe it is. Muir, is it, Miss—?\\nQ. Muir.\\nMODERATOR. Muir. She is 16 years old, I am told, Mr. President. Go ahead, Miss Muir.\\nQ. Good afternoon, Mr. President, and thank you for this opportunity to talk to you.\\nA. Thank you, Colleen.\\nQ. Oh, I was wondering since the volunteer draft program isn't working too well that you'd put a draft system into effect, and if you would, would you draft women the same as men, as the Equal Rights Amendment infers?\\nA. Well, Colleen, we don't have any plans now to put in a draft system. So far we are still getting by with the voluntary armed forces. The major problem has been in the reserves. We are about S00, er, 800,000 people short, I believe now, in Reserve recruitment. The regular armed forces are holding their own. But if I see it's necessary in the future to initiate a draft, then I would certainly recommend to the Congress that this be done. I would like to combine it with a much more comprehensive public service opportunity, where people might go into jobs like the Peace Corps or VISTA or teachers’ aides, mental institutions, and so forth, along with military training as well. And I would make it much more all‐inclusive than it has been in the past. I would not, for instance, exclude college students, and if it becomes necessary for national security, the likelihood is that women would be included as well. But I'd like to draw a distinction between military service and other service that would benefit our country just as much in a time of need or crisis. But I might re‐emphasize that at this time we have no intention of going to a draft.\\nQ. O.K. Thank you.\\nFurther Concern About Uganda\\nCALLER NO.27\\nMODERATOR: Thank you, Miss Muir. From Jerry Wildman, the next call, Mr. President. He's in Lake Worth. Fla.\\nQ. Good afternoon. Mr, President.\\nA. Good afternoon, Jay.\\nQ. Before I get to my question I would just like to acid that I'm a candidate to the United State Naval Academy. and I hope to follow along in your footsteps. Now to my question. I would like to know what actions would be taken if any hostile acts would be taken against American or Allied citizens living in Uganda.\\nA. O.K., that was a question that early on the program, Jerry. I might just say that we had this question come up last weekend. We tried to handle it in a very unpublicized and careful way, knowing the unpredictability of Idi Amin, and I just let him know very\\nforcefully and frankly that we were concerned about American citizens and we also got other nations who have communications and the understanding better than we do, to deal with him and to help us there. I understand from the news that about eight ar 10 different foreign leaders, mostly from the Moslem countries contacted Amin. The West Germans helped us a great deal, and the crisis was averted. But I would guess that if this should recur in the future, and I hope it won't, that we'll handle it in the same way, Jerry.\\nQ. Oh, I see. Well thank you very much Mr. President.\\nEasing Burden Of Health Costs\\nCALLER NO, 28\\nMODERATOR: Next question from Samuel Rankin of Billings, Mont., Mr. President.\\nQ. Good afternoon, Mr. President.\\nA. Good afternoon, Sam.\\nQ. I have a two‐part question. The first is broken into two minor economic questions, and I hope that this has not been covered previously. If it has, maybe you would like to add some things that possibly you didn't get to add on the previous question.\\nI would like your commitment and your comments on a resolution in the public's favor that would alleviate the painfully high cost of medical care in the U.S. And I know also that these two are related—a total commitment to the lowering of the transfer payments, which I believe are near 46 percent of the income derived by the government from corporate and individual taxes.\\nA. Mr. Rankin, I don't know any way to answer your question very well at this point. I might say that these are two questions. that we're working on simultaneously. The income tax changes are part of the transfer of payments. Also the welfare system in its entirety needs to be reformed.\\nAnd by the first of May, Joe Califano who's the new Secretary of H.E.W., working with literally hundreds of different people, will come up for me and for the Congress with a comprehensive reform of the welfare system. It will be I would say next year before we can complete an adequate analysis of the health care system as a whole.\\nNow, we're trying now to hold down the cost of both medicine, treatment and also hospital care, but I can't answer your question yet.\\nQ. All right.\\nA. The first part of the answer, though, will be forthcoming May the 1st, with a welfare reform package, the second part, Sept. 3, with income tax revision proposals. And the comprehensive health care would probably have to wait until next year. There's just so much we can do the first year, Sam.\\nQ. I appreciate that.\\nA. I'm sorry.\\nQ. And then the second part of my question, Mr. President. With many of our young people so involved in the past and presently with Vietnam, I would like to respectfully suggest that possibly you appoint a young person, preferably a Vietnam veteran, to accompany the mission headed for, or headed by Leonard Woodcock and including my state's most distinguished member in the Senate, Senator Mansfield, going to Vietnam in the near future. I believe this would help many of us, myself included, who felt hesitant in going to Vietnam and would now like to feel that we are helping rebuild that country.\\nAnd 1 respectfully request that my naine be included on that list if and when you do decide to include a young member. And my wife wants me to be sure and say that if you're ever in Billings, Mont., that we would more than like to have you stay at our home.\\nA. Well, that's a nice invitation for you. My roommate at. the Naval Academy back in ancient days was from Butte, Mont. His name was Blue Middleton, and I heard a lot about Montana from him. And of course, Senator Mike Mansfield is one of the most distinguished members of Congress that has ever served in our country.\\nThe five members who will go to Vietnam have already been chosen. And Leonard Woodcock will be the chairman. As you said, Mike Mansfield will go. A woman, Marian Edelman, will also be on the trip. And a professional diplomat will go along. And also one member of the House of Representatives as well. And, unfortunately, we won't have a veteran of the Vietnam war. I thought about this, Sam. And also, I thought about sending a member of an M.I.A. family.\\nQ. Right.\\nA. But my judgment was that we probably ought not to get people there who are so deeply and emotionally involved in the process. We've been encouraged so far—nobody can predict what's going to happen in the future—at. the response of the Vietnamese Government. And I think they want to reestablish relations with our own country.\\nThey need help in exploring for oil, and in other ways. They need to trade with the outside world and not be completely dependent upon the Communist countries like China and Russia. And of course we want to get an accounting for the more 2,500 Americans who still are not completely accounted for in Vietnam.\\nSo you have a good suggestion, but I've already chosen the five people, and they are now getting ready to go. They will arrive in Vietnam, if the plans go through, I think the 16th of March. So it's well under way.\\nQ. Good, good. I think Your proposal, your counterpoint to mine, was well taken and I can understand, you know, your thinking behind choosing someone that necessarily isn't .\\nMODERATOR: Thank you very much, Mr. Rankin. Thank you, sir, for calling. I'm going to suggest, Mr. President, that because we only have about 35 minutes left, that from here on out we ask the callers to limit themselves to one question. Or possibly a follow‐up, if it's really necessary. But let's limit each caller to one subject matter at any rate.\\nCALLER No. 29\\nMODERATOR: The next caller, Mr. Louis Lawson of Riichmod, Va. Mr. Lawson.\\nQ. Mr. Cronkite, President Carter: my name is Russell, you may call me Russell. Unfortunately I had two questions before Mr. Cronkite had me limited to one, but I have one that is really uppermost in my mind.\\nI was wondering if you feel there's any inequity in passing laws which en‐ courage the hiring of members of minority groups and women, while passing such laws implies resisting hiring equally qualified white males?\\nA: Yes I don't like that concept either. I think that most of the laws that have been passed have been designed very narrowly to insure that there is no continued discrimination against somebody because they are in a minority group or women.\\nNow the courts have interpreted this to mean that if a company, for instance, has historically excluded men and women from the labor force, for the old labor force, that they have to go back to take corrective action. But I think that all of the laws with which I am familiar, on equal employment opportunity, just guarantee that now and in the future there won't be discrimination and that if there has been a history of discrimination it will be corrected.\\nQ: I hope that's true. I've been unemployed for a while and I feel like I'm the victim of this kind of system. I want to say, though, before I go, that I'm really impressed by your desire to involve Americans more closely in the government, and I'm so pleased to have had the chance to talk to you. Thank you, President Carter.\\nA: Thank you. I might have to say that I've got a question we can answer, I think, from the man and his wife from Utah about the exclusion for disabled people. This was removed from the income tax law in the 1976 act—that is, sick pay exclusion for anyone except the permanently disabled. The Congress gave as its reason—and it sounded like a good reason—that such sick persons could deduct their medical expenses from the income tax and would therefore get a double benefit, and when anybody in our society, even if it is an afflicted person or disabled person, has a special exclusion, then other people have to pay the taxes for them. This is one of the things that will be assessed this year, and we may or may not put the double credit back for the permanently disabled, but my guess is that it would not be put back in.\\nAid to Veterans Of Korean War\\nCALLER NO.30\\nMODERATOR: The next caller. Mr. President, is Mrs. Cheryl Quinn of Cleveland, Ohio. Mrs, Quinn?\\nQ. Hello, Mr. President, I want to thank you for doing a great job and thank you for the inauguration ticket, and also my morn was in the Korean War and after she got out, she was signed up to get X‐ray technician and she had to come up back to New York from Texas and then she got married and had kids and then she didn't give her what she wanted. They only gave her eight months of schooling and she has three years and some.\\nA. And you want to know what can be done about it, Cheryl, is that the question?\\nQ. Yes I do.\\nA. Well, she may have let her time run out on the G.I. Bill of Rights. That's probably what happened, the way you describe it. I don't think we can do anything about it. To be perfectly frank with you, without changing the law to make a special case for your mother and those like her, I doubt that it could be changed, Cheryl. When the law was written the Congress put into it that after a certain period of years—I think 10 years—that the G.I. benefits would be lost. But I'll have someone on my staff check out the case and see if there's something that can be done about it within the law itself. And they'll give you a call back this coming week. O.K.?\\nMODERATOR: Let me remind you that these calls are not being screened in any way for content. There's no censorship at all as the calls conic into us here in the Oval Office of the White House.\\nPay Increase For Congress\\nCALLER NO. 31\\nMODERATOR. Gerald Anderson, Denver, Colo. is the next caller.\\nQ. Mr. President.\\nA. Hi, Gerald.\\nQ. I'm wondering what is the justification with you trying to reduce the Federal budget—the justification behind the S12,000 pay increase to the Congress? How can you lower the budget by giving them $12,000 a year, and us $50 back\\nA. Gerald, that's a hard question for me to answer.\\nQ. That's why I thought I'd throw it at you.\\nA. I think you probably know that there is a law that was passed by Congress and the previous Presidents before I came into office that said that a commission would recommend pay levels for the Congress and for others like Federal judges and Cabinet officers, and unless the Congress voted no, that the pay raises would go into effect.\\nIn other words, if the Congress does nothing, the pay raises go into effect. And that's what occurred. That law's been in the books for quite a while.\\nQ. All right. What I'm getting at, though, is with you trying to lower the budget why did you not try and do something to stop that if there was anything that could be done to stop it, why couldn't they some way be convinced that it was against, you know, the fiscal matters of the country to give them this increase?\\nA. Well I might say that I think that the salary increases were justified. And one of the things that President Ford asked me to do before I was inaugurated, while lie was still in office, was to add my support to the increase in salaries, I agreed not to object to the increase, provided there was a strict law on ethics tied to it, to limit the outside income of Congress members and to remove the conflicts of interest that exist between—with them—and also with people serving in the executive branch of Government.\\nI do think that the law ought to be changed, Gerald, to make sure that in the future if any sort of salary increase goes into effect that it not go into effect until after the following general election.\\nI think this would help a great deal to make all of us more careful about it and it would mean that if Congress doesn't veto an increase that they would not get an increase in salary until after they had to face the voters again in the next general election.\\nWith that change I would be in favor of continuing the law as it is.\\nQ. So there was no way that you could have stopped this increase? ‘\\nA. That's correct. I didn't have any authority over it. But I have to. say to you I could have made speeches around the country against it, but it was not my inclination to do so.\\nQ. Don't you feel that with the Congress people receiving this excessive amount of money compared to . the average working person that it .puts him out of touch with reality as far as what the average person has to go through to live in this country?\\nA. Well I can't say that you're exactly right on that. No, I have seen from my own experience that it costs a member of Congress an enormous amount of extra money to maintain close contacts with the people back home, quite often to finance and to own a house, say, in Colorado where you live, and also to buy and to own or to rent an extremely expensive house here in Washington.\\nAlso, the Congress member in order to stay in office and to build up seniority to serve you and the other people around Denver better has to run for office every two years. Now there are some members of Congress who have no trouble raising money for a political campaign.\\nOthers have to spend a lot of their own money in a political campaign. If you compare say a member of Congress who has to‐do that with a Federal judge who lives in. Denver full time, who doesn't have to run for office, who gets the same amount of pay and who doesn't have the constant political world to live in and to deal with all kinds of complicated and very controversial questions like a Congressman does all in the open, I think that a Congressman deserves just as much salary as a Federal judge.\\nSo it cuts both ways and I think, Gerald, that in fairness to the Members of Congress—I've never been in Congress, as you know—there are some extraordinary expenses that a Member of Congress has that an average person, even a public servant like a Federal judge, does not have.\\nBut I believe that one change that I described to you ought to be made and that is to let future salary increases go into effect only after the next general election.\\nMODERATOR. It is also true, Mr. President, isn't it, that the Members of Congress, members of the Judiciary and the Executive Branch who are entitled to these raises, had not had one for a very long time and had fallen far behind the general cost‐of‐living increases.\\nA. I think the last raise went into effect about eight years ago.\\nI might say, Walter, that I made a mistake a while ago. I got my decimal point wrong on the shortage in the Reserve figures because of not having a draft. The total Reserve is about 800,000 and the shortage is about 10 percent of that‐70,000 or 80,000. Somebody just called in and said that I said the shortage was 800,000 and I'm sorry I made that mistake.\\nMODERATOR. An officer in the Reserve, I would guess.\\nA. I guess so.\\nCALLER NO. 32\\nMODERATOR. Sgt. David Cash of Miliani, Hawaii, is on the phone, Mr. President, our first call from the State of Hawaii. Sergeant Cash.\\nMODERATOR:... of Miliani, Hawaii, is on the phone, Mr. President, the first call from the state of Hawaii. Sgt. Cash.\\nQ. Good morning, Mr. President.\\nA. Good afternoon, Mr. Cash.\\nQ. I'm with the 25th Infantry Training Comand and we have a Taekwono program, which is a Korean martial art, and it's been with the 25th Infantry for the last three years, and we train Army ‐personnel in it, you know, to be a better soldier in discipline and mentally condition, and they turn out to be real better soldiers, real good soldiers, and I wonder how much difficult a problem, I mean. throughout the whole Army, United States Army, that we could have a program like that, establishing ... infantry division?\\nMODERATOR: Do you understand what the program is, Mr. President, because I'm afraid I don't?\\nA. Could you tell me very briefly, Mr. Cash, Sergeant Cash, what the program is again?\\nQ. It's Taekwondo. It's a Korean martial art, like you have karate in Japan, in which we train the personnel which come in the division, as a .\\nA. I understand now. I think it's probably a good program to have, Sargent Cash. When I went through. my own Navy training, I had the equivalent of karate training as part of my own preparation for military service. I might say that I broke my right .collarbone in the process, but I recovered from it, and I think that the most severe kinds of physical training for combat soldiers is probably beneficial. It obviously ought to be done without abuse and without damage to the person, but I think that to be in top physical shape and know how to deal with personal hand‐to‐hand combat is a good thing. I hope I've understood your question properly.\\nDisagreement On Drug Use\\nCALLER NO. 33\\nMODERATOR: Thank you very much, Sargent Cash, and let's go to the next telephone call from Walter Lipman of Spring Valley in New York.\\nQ. Good afternoon, Mr. President.\\nA. Good afternoon. I'm rather amazed at being able to get a hold of you. This question is something that a bunch of friends of mine and I bandied back and forth and swore would never get on the air, but anyhow. Mr. President, it seems to—well, to me and my friends —that the term “drug addict” is more a function of one's social station than anything else.\\nMany famous people, such as Sigmund Freud, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who wrote “Sherlock Holmes,” and Dr. William Halstead, who was one of the founders of the Johns Hopkins Medical School, were quite heavy users of drugs such as cocaine and morphine, and yet were considered leaders of society in their day.\\nNow in this light, doesn't the prosecution of drug users and their habits by the Drug Enforcement Administra‐ tion seem capricious, arbitrary and rather unjust?\\nA. No, it doesn't—well, not to me. I established a drug treatment program In Georgia while I was in office there as Governor. In July of 1972, I believe it was, we had 1 1 deaths in the Atlanta area from heroin overdose, primarily  among young people. We put in a drug treatment program and kind of opened the whole question up to public awareness in October. And in the following 12, months, we had zero heroin deaths.\\nI've been in our treatment centers throughout the state of Georgia. In fact, my sons have worked in those treatment centers. And I've seen literally hundreds of young people's lives almost completely destroyed, by addiction to heroin in particular.\\nI think that a question like morphine would be a different one altogether. Morphine Is a drug that's, as you know, administered legally—or as a previous caller said, a medication that's administered legally. But I would do all I can and am moving as aggressively as possible to stamp out the traffic in drugs like cocaine or heroin.\\nI‐ believe they are a devastating affliction on our society and ought to be eliminated as much as we can.\\nQ. Mr. President, do you know the origin of the drug heroin?\\nA. Yes, I know it comes from poppies.\\nQ. No, but the purpose of it.\\nMODERATOR. Mr. Lipman, I thank you very much for your call but we're running a little short of time and we do want to get as many calls in as possible.\\nOffering Praise Over Parden\\nCALLER NO. 34\\nMODERATOR. So we're going to move right along to Paul Guertin of Cudahy, Wis.\\nQ. Mr. President?\\nA. Yes, Paul\\nQ. One thing I have always wished\\nI could tell you and now I have the chance, and that's pardoning the draft dodgers or evaders was one of the best things you could probably ever do because I feel that if somebody dodged the draft or was an objector of it, obviously they had a reason and they should be listened to, and forcing somebody to do something, even if they object to it or don't believe in it, is just taking away their rights.\\nMODERATOR: Do you have a question, Mr. Guertin, for the President.\\nQ. Not really. I just wanted to say that.\\nA. I might say that that was one of the most difficult decisions I made. I made my decision, though, quite early in the campaign. I never did mislead the American people about it. I made the major public announcement at the American Legion Convention out in the state of Washington last year—one of the most critical audiences I could have had. I've just seen some public opinion poll results this week that showed that about 45 percent of the American people thought I made a‐mistake, about 45 percent of the American people thought I did the right thing and the other 10 percent didn't have any opinion. So there's no way to suit people. I feel that it's time for us to get over the Vietnam War as soon as we can, and I believe that those who have been excluded from living in our wonderful country for the last 10 or 12 years have been punished pretty severely. So I think that the deserters and all, as I said earlier on this program, ought to be handled on an individual case basis within the Department of Defense, and they are expediting their assessment of cases and will handle them under normal military and legal proce‐\\nQ. It was really nice being able to talk to you. Thank you very much.\\nU.S. Restrictions On the Concorde\\nCALLER NO. 35\\nMODERATOR: The next call is from John‐Raymond Lau of Yorktown Heights, N.Y.\\nQ. Mr. President?\\nA. Go right ahead.\\nQ. How are you doing, Mr. President? A. Fine.\\nQ. I'd like to know what your opinion is of the French‐English Concorde, and with the elections in France this week, do you feel that rejection of the Concorde would bring the power to the French Communist Party, and also I'd like to say that many French citizens are counting on the SST to keep France from going the Communist way. So what is your opinion on that?\\nA: O.K. Our Government has already expressed its opinion, Mr. Lau. The previous administration authorized the Concorde to come into our country for a 15‐month trial period, and a couple of weeks ago I made a statement that I agreed with that decision and thought the Concorde ought to be given chance to fulfill its trial itself.\\nAs you know, under the Federal law I have authority over Dulles Airport, and so did President Ford, and we're permitting the test flights to come into Dulles and we're very carefully monitoring the environmental consequences of the SST flights, including primarily noise.\\nKennedy Airport in New York is not under my control at all. I have nothing to do with it, no authority over it. The New. York Port Authority has that decision to make and I understand that on March 10 they are going to make a decision whether the Concorde can come in for test flights or not. I don't know what that decision will be.\\nI.talked to President Giscard from France yesterday about the Concorde, and also talked to Gov. Hugh Carey to let Gov. Carey know, as President Giscard had asked me to, that the French people consider this a very important Issue.\\nMy own statement to President Giscard is that we are not concerned about the SST flights because of commercial competition—about six years ago our ôwn Congress decided not to go into the SST building business—and the whole problem in our country is noise and environmental quality maintenance.\\nNow, I might say one other thing. I think that the noise standards in our country are going to be stricter and stricter in the future and not more and more lenient, and the same noise standards ought to apply to an airplane whether it's a Concorde or a Lockheed or some other kind or any sort of American commercial plane, so I think we can establish strict environmental laws. I think they ought to apply to the SST flying a course at subsonic speeds and our own commercial planes the same.\\nBut it's the environmental question that will exclude the Concorde if it is excluded and not any sort of animosity toward the French people, nor is it any commercial competition between us and France on SST flights.\\nCALLER NO. 36\\nMODERATOR. Thank you, Mr. Lau. The next call is from Mrs. Runy Hewitt of San Bernardino, Calif.\\nQ. Yes. Good afternoon, President Carter.\\nA. Good afternoon, Mrs. Hewitt.\\nQ. Thank you for giving this time to the American people to speak with you; it is indeed a privilege we appreciate.\\nA. Thank you, ma'am.\\nQ. My question is why is It that veterans and Civil Service retirees are given two costs of living a year but only one cost of living to Social Security retirees?\\nA. I don't know. I didn't realize that there was that difference, Mrs. Hewitt. That's the kind of question that I'm afraid I'll have to get an answer to, if there is an answer, and call you back about it Monday. I doubt if I'll have time to give the answer by the end of this program since we only have about 15 minutes to go. But I'll try to get the answer back to you.\\nQ. May I say that my brother's last wish was to be buried In Georgia, in Bluffton. Nolan Frisby. He was in the service there, and he's written me many letters about Georgia and how lovely it was.\\nA. Thank you very much.\\nQ. Beautiful people there.\\nA. Thank you so much. I might say that in Plains, which is a tiny little town, we have a Hewitt family. Maybe they'll tend to you and your brother.\\nQ. No, my name was Frisby before, and this is Nolan Frisby, he's passed away now, but his request was to be buried in Bluffton, where his family is now.\\nA. Oh, very good. Thank you, ma'am.\\nCALLER NO. 37\\nMODERATOR: Thank you, Mrs. Hewitt. John Caldwell of Atlanta, Ga., is on the phone, Mr. President, and I'm advised he's 17 years old. Mr. Caldwell?\\nQ. Yes. Good afternoon, President Carter.\\nA. How're you doing?\\nQ. I'm 17 years old, and I'd like to know, do you plan to make any other place than Plains, Ga., your White House away from Washington?\\nA. No, sir. The only other place that I anticipate going on a fairly regular basis, as I mentioned early in the program, is to Camp David, which is a place for Presidents and has been used ever since Franklin Roosevelt was in office. But I don't intend to have several White Houses, as has been the case in the past.\\nQ. Thank you very much.\\nCALLER NO. 38\\nMODERATOR: Thank you, John Caldwell, and the next caller on the line is Ms. Leslie Pfenninger of Lanham, Md., Mr. President. Miss Pfenninger?\\nQ. Hello, President Carter, it's good to speak with you.\\nA. Thank you, Leslie.\\nQ. I'm a 1976 college graduate whose goal is to enter the Civil Service. And I've been working toward that goal since May. I might say it's a depressing effect to find the doors completely shut, and I'd like to know if the restrictions will be lifted to permit individuals like me to compete for jobs now only open to those currently in Civil Service or those of a reinstatable status.\\nA. Leslie, what is your profession or special training?\\nQ. I have a dual B.A. In psychology and sociology, and I also qualify as a statistician.\\nA. The best thing for me to do is to check on your particular case with the Civil Service and give you a call back this coming week about prospects for employment in the future, and I presume that the Civil Service has a record of your application, is that cor‐\\nYes, sir, they do.\\nA. We'll be back in touch with you next week.\\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. I hope you continue this kind of direct contact with the\\nA. Good luck to you.\\nAn Invitation To Minnesota\\nCALLER NO. 39\\nMODERATOR: I bet, Miss Pfenninger, when they told you the best way to get a job is just knock on a lot of doors, they didn't ever suggest telephoning the President on a national call‐in show, but it seems to work. You're going to get an answer from him.\\nLes Wenz of Pittsburgh, Pa., is on the phone, Mr. President.\\nQ. Good afternoon, Mr. President.\\nA. Russ, how are you doing?\\nQ. Very well. And I want to tell you you're doing wonderful, and I hope Congress keeps you going. I have a brief review and then a question.\\nPresident Calvin Coolidge came to Cannon Falls, Minn., on July 29, 1928, to dedicate the monument to Col. William Caldwell, he was a Civil War hero. Last July the local American Legion post there suggested to the mayor that they issue a proclamation July 29 of each year as annual Presidents Day. And on this day they're going to have a reaffirmation of our national unity problems, and what we could do and try in the rededication of our national ideals and that sort of thing.\\nThe question, Mr. President, is: Would it be possible for you to accept an invitation from the Governor of Minnesota, or Mayor Geller of Cannon Falls to be the speaker at this national Presidents Day?\\nA. Mr. Wenz, I doubt it. This first year, I've tried to hold down as much as possible any public speaking on my part. I really need to learn more about this job, and as you know I've got a very good partner up here from Minnesota who might be available. I can't speak for him, but Fritz Mondale might be a possibility.\\nBut I appreciate very much the invitation. If they would write me a letter, we can give then an official answer on it. And also I appreciate the concept of reaffirming our patriotism in not only a national way, but also a local way, as you all have done.\\nQ. One of the things we'd like to do is remind everyone that a number of men in their prime of life gave up their life or were injured seriously, you know; that that's why we have our freedom and independence.\\nA. Good luck to you.\\nQ. Thank you.\\nCALLER NO. 40\\nMODERATOR. Thank you, Mr. Wenz. And your next caller, Mr. President, is Mr. Kerry Kimble of Fulton, Mo. Mr. Kimble.\\nQ. Yes, Mr. President, my question covers the War Powers Resolution. Do you feel that it infringes upon your power as Commander in Chief in the limiting or getting the approval from Congress to continue the use of American forces in a certain situation past the 60 days?\\nA. Mr. Kimble, it is a reduction obviously in the authority that the President has had prior to the Vietnam War, but I think it's an appropriate reduction. My own attitude toward government is that I would never see our nation approach a time of war with any sort of predictability about it without discussing it thoroughly and frequently with the Congress and also letting the American people know what is going on.\\nAnd although we did get involved in the Vietnam War and even fought extensively in Cambodia without telling the American people and sometimes lying to them, I would never have that inclination.\\nSo I have no hesitancy about communicating with Congress, consulting with them and also letting the American people know what we do before we start any combat operation.\\nAnd I think with that process we can minimize greatly the chances that we will get involved in combat anywhere in the world.\\nQ. Sir, would you accept their approval for your action on that?\\nA. Yes. There is, I think there is, I think, a provision that in a time of crisis where an unanticipated attack might be launched against our country's security that I could act. But to continue any sort of military operation I would have to get the Congress's aproyal and I have no doubt that that's the right thing to do.\\nNegotiations With Panama\\nCALLER NO, 41\\nMODERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Kimble. Thank you, and the next call is from Mr. Johnie Strickland, Fayetteville, N.C.\\nQ. Good afternoon, Mr. President. This is Johnie Strickland from Fayetteville, N. C. I want to thank you for this opportunity to talk with you, and I would like to know what your sentiments are on the Panama Canal 1904 treaty and changing it.\\nA. O.K. It's good to hear from you, Mr. Strickland. My sister lives in Fayetteville, as you may know, and I am glad to answer your question. We are now negotiating with Panama as effectively as we can. As you may or may not know, the treaty signed when Theodore Roosevelt was President gave Panama sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone itself. It gave us control over the Panama Canal Zone, as though we had sovereignty. So we've always had a legal sharing of responsibility over the Panama Canal Zone. As far as sovereignty is concerned, I don't have any hangup about that. I would hope that after, and expect that after the year 2000 that we would have an assured capacity or capability of our country with Panama guaranteeing that the Panama Canal would be open and of use to our own nation and to other countries. So that's the subject of the negotiation now—it has been going quite a while—is to phase out our military operations in the Panama Canal Zone, but to guarantee that even after the year 2000 that we would still be able to keep the Panama Canal open to the use of American and other ships.\\nQ. I understand, and I certainly hope that we are not too lenient, because we have lots of money invested in the Canal Zone and I really think the Canal Zone belongs to us, a whole lot more than most people think it does.\\nPublic School Commitment\\nCALLER NO. 42\\nMODERATOR. Thank you, Mr. Strickland, and the next call comes from Miss Michelle Stanley of North Benton, Ohio, and Mr. President, Miss Stanley is 11 years old.\\nQ. Jimmy? Hi, .I just had to thank you for sending me the inauguration—to your inauguration.\\nA. Did you get a chance to come?\\nQ. No, I didn't, but I was just happy to get it. But I have another question. Why doesn't Amy go to a private school?\\nA. Well, I hope sometimes, Michelle, you could come and visit with Amy. She goes to the public school and did in Georgia, when we lived there as well. She enjoys it very much and I have a very strong commitment to the public school system and don't have anything against the private school system, but I think it helps the public schools in Washington, D.C., to have the President's daughter go there. And it indicates to other parents that I have confidence in the public school system all over the country. Amy goes to school with children, I think, from 26 foreign nations as well as from our own country. And so far she likes the school very much. So because of my commitment to the public school and because Amy likes it. those are the reasons, Michelle. Good luck to you.\\n1 might say. Walter, that l've got an answer to Mrs. John Ritchey's question about the payment for the Ottawa Indian lands. This bill has already been signed into law and there's $10.2 million to he distributed to members of the Ottawa tribe. The Department of Interior is right now writing rules for the distribution of the funds, and by late summer of this year, the money will be distributed. So that ought to he good news for Mrs. John Ritchey of Georgetown, Ky.\\nMODERATOR: Mr. President, you got the answer there for her just in time because we have just about run out of time. I'm just curious, Mr. President. before we close this off today, what you thought of the questions you got to this first experiment in meeting the people through the telephone call‐in broadcast.\\nA. Walter, I liked it. The questions that come in from people all over the country are the kind that you would never get in a press conference—the news people would never raise, like the Ottawa Indian question. And I think it's very good for me to understand directly from the American people what they are concerned about and questions that have never been asked of me and reported through the news media, so my inclination would be to do this again in the future, and I'll wait and see how the American people react to it to see whether or not I've done a good job to make it worth their while.\\nBut I want to thank you for being here with me this afternoon. The two hours passed very quickly and I've enjoyed it and learned a lot from it.\\nMODERATOR: I think it is indeed, and we'd be glad to sign you again, Mr. President.\\nA. Good deal.\\nMODERATOR: We have run out of time. We thank you for your time and the cooperation of your entire staff in making this broadcast possible. We regret such a small number of those who wanted to talk with you actually did get to call in and from many of you who did call in and didn't get through to the President, we apologize for that. A special thanks to all of you who are interested in this new broadcast idea, and from President Carter and me in the Oval Office of the White House, good afternoon.\\nI'm Walter Cronkite, CBS News.\"], dtype=object)"
